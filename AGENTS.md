This Go project is a discord bot that hosts user-defined games of bingo. Users specify via csv a list of events, which are distributed with the players specified during creation. Players can vote on events that happened to try and complete their board.

This project aims to teach me Golang; hand-holding through implementation is preferred instead of doing it by yourself. I would like to do things in an idiomatic manner and follow good Go standards/guidelines.

Discordgo (the library we use for the discord interaction) documentation can be found at https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo/tree/master/docs.
